📢 **Wordle Bot Announcement**

Hello Wordle players! The wordle bot has been updated quite a bit recently, with the following improvements:
1. Nicer leaderboard formatting with SVG images, and leaderboards only get sent if you press the "publish" button (so you can view them yourself without spamming the channel!).
2. Faster performance on leaderboard calculations in channels that have already been scanned.
3. Slightly faster /sync command performance, which now supports syncing up to 50,000 messages historically!

Hopefully there are no bugs! But if there are, please email details to wilson@wilsoniumite.com

You're receiving this message because this channel has been used recently to track Wordle results.
